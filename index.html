                        Rick Sanchez is the co-eponymous main character 
                        and leading protagonist of the show. He is a 
                        genius scientist whose alcoholism and reckless, 
                        nihilistic behavior are a source of concern for his 
                        daughter's family, as well as the safety of their son,                             Morty. He is voiced by Justin Roiland.

                <img src="images/MortyGif.GIF" class="Rickless">
                    <p>
                        Morty is possibly the stabilizing influence in Rick's 
                        life that keep Rick from doing things that could end 
                        up doing a lot of harm though this does not work on many 
                        occasions. When Rick messes up, Morty is the one who 
                        convinces him to fix things. 

                        Though Morty often frustrates him, Rick seems to get 
                        very upset at the idea of not being able to have 
                        adventures with Morty.

                    <p>
                        Morty's older sister, a more conventional teenager 
                        who values her image and constant access to cell phones.

                    <p>
                        Morty's insecure father, who strongly disapproves of Rick's 
                        influence over his son. His marriage is jeopardized by Jerry's 
                        poor relationship with father-in-law Rick. Jerry works at a 
                        low-level advertising agency.

                            horses. Level-headed and assertive, she struggles with her 
                            husband over his ego, which thrives in defiance of his 
                            proven mediocrity.
